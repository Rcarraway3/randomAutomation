# Copy Paste Automations: Build Checklist

**Goal:** Every automation is a single .py file. Drop it in the target directory, double-click, and it handles the taskâ€”no config, no setup, no dependencies (unless noted).

## Required Pattern: Dependency Self-Healing

Every script must check for required dependencies at runtime. If a dependency is missing, the script will attempt to install it automatically using pip, then retry the import. If installation fails, the script exits with a clear error.

**Copy-paste this snippet at the top of any script that needs external packages:**

```python
import sys
import subprocess

def ensure_package(pkg):
    try:
        __import__(pkg)
    except ImportError:
        print(f"[INFO] '{pkg}' not found. Attempting to install...")
        subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', pkg])
        try:
            __import__(pkg)
        except ImportError:
            print(f"[ERROR] Failed to install '{pkg}'. Exiting.")
            sys.exit(1)

# Example usage:
# ensure_package('pandas')
# ensure_package('openpyxl')
```

- Script must be autonomous: drop in, double-click, done.
- If dependencies are needed, prompt user to install (`pip install ...`).
- No config files, no manual setup. All logic in the script.
- Add debug logs and clear output for every action.
